# Archmerged-XFCE
My Archmerge with XFCE Desktop

Learning linux with Erik Debois.  Along the way, learning the "in/out" of github.

11/15/2017 - I'm changing direction on this project.  I've started with a plain-vanilla install of arch.  I basically followed the installation guide on the Arch Wiki website.  I'm creating and adding scripts to automate the creation of the complete operating system.  Once again, Thanks to Erik Debois for his work and inspiration!

Thanks!  Jake
